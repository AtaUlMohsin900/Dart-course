// In Dart, **keywords** are reserved words that have special meaning and cannot be used as identifiers
//  (like variable or function names). They form the core syntax of the language. Dart keywords can be categorized 
//  as **reserved words** (e.g., `if`, `for`, `class`, `void`) which are always forbidden, and **contextual keywords** 
//  (e.g., `async`, `await`, `show`, `hide`) which have special meaning only in specific contexts and can be used as 
//  identifiers elsewhere. Keywords are essential for defining control flow (`if`, `else`), declaring variables 
//  (`var`, `final`, `const`), creating classes (`class`, `extends`), and handling asynchronous operations (`async`, `await`),
//   providing the building blocks for Dart programs.
